# Hackweek 23 : RKE2 and Rancher deployment with Pulumi

## Project Description
Terraform and Ansible are used within the Consulting Team for automating RKE2 and Rancher deployments, but with the change in Open-Source License of Terraform and the RedHat “problems”, I think there is a need for an alternative solution like Pulumi. I have no experience with Pulumi and there isn’t much documentation around it (regarding Rancher and Terraform). There is a Package for Rancher but nothing for RKE2.

## Goal
Build an example solution for installing RKE2 and Rancher with Pulumi (including things like Longhorn and other Apps) and present it to the team.
